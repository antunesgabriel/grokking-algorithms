# grokking-algorithms
This repository contains my practice with what I learned from reading the Grokking Algorithms book.

With each chapter that I finish I will include examples of algorithms that I learned in the chapter (The examples may not be the same, as I like to take what I learned and create other use cases in other problems). I am using the Go language to write the algorithms in this repository. 

> **Status:** Currently I'm reading the chapter 4
